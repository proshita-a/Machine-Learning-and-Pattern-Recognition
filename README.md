Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition – Lab Work

This repository contains the complete lab work completed as part of the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (AI 3011) course at Plaksha University during the Spring 2025–26 semester . The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with core machine learning concepts by implementing algorithms and techniques discussed in lectures using real-world and synthetic datasets.

The lab assignments cover a wide range of topics including data preprocessing and feature engineering, clustering methods (K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN), dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, ICA, LDA), classification and regression models (KNN, SVMs, ensemble methods), performance evaluation metrics, and an introduction to neural networks and deep learning concepts. Emphasis is placed on understanding the underlying intuition behind each method, analyzing model behavior, and evaluating results rather than treating models as black boxes.

All implementations are done primarily in Python and focus on building a strong foundation in pattern recognition and machine learning workflows. This repository serves as a learning record demonstrating practical exposure to ML fundamentals, algorithmic thinking, and experimental analysis developed through structured lab exercises.

Note: These labs were completed as part of academic coursework and are shared for learning and portfolio purposes only.
